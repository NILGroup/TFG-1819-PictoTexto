In this chapter will be presented, the motivation behind this project, the objectives that we set ourselves at the beginning of the final degree project and the development methodology that we have followed, throughout the work. Also, at the end of this chapter we indicate the structure of this document.

\section{Motivation}

Communication is a fundamental part of social and human growth, but some people with functional diversity find many obstacles to achieve effective communication. The appearance of different communication channels, such as pictograms, which are graphic images that relate to some object or concept, these have been a great advance for communication in this group. But the reality is that communication is still very limited and sometimes it is limited to people with the same type of functional diversity and specialists trained in this area. This is the case of the people whose way of communication are the pictograms, because many people do not know the meaning of the pictograms, this reason make the communication with this people is notably reduced or in many cases impossible. 

For that reasons, there is a need to create a tool that facilitated the communication of those people who use pictograms with their environment, a software capable of translating pictograms into language. There are currently multiple tools that allow the translation of natural language pictograms but not natural language pictograms. This software tool will allow to break down barriers and help the social inclusion of people whose functional diversity is at risk of exclusion.


The main beneficiaries of this tool will be users with problems to communicate through natural language and who need to rely on the pictograms, such as people with cerebral palsy, autism or any other type of cognitive disability.
Also, this work is designed to help these people to be able to communicate in any daily situation such as being able to order a refreshment in a bar, expressing their desire to eat macaroni, or expressing activities they have done or will be doing in the future, such as go on a excursion. Something so simple that unfortunately for these people it is not so much.
