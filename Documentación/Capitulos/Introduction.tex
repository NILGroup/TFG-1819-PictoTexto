\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cap:introduction}
 
In this chapter will be presented, the motivation behind this project, the goals that were set at the beginning of the project and the methodology that we have followed throughout the work. Also, at the end of this chapter we present the structure of this document.

\section{Motivation}

Communication is a fundamental part of social and human growth, but some people with functional diversity find many handicaps to achieve effective communication. The appearance of different communication channels, such as pictograms( graphic images that represent a object or a concept), has been a great advance for communication in this collective. But the reality is that communication is still very limited and sometimes it is limited to people with the same type of functional diversity or specialists trained in this area. This is the case of people whose way of communication are pictograms, many people do not know the meaning of the pictograms, which makes the communication with this people impossible or notably reduced. 

For that reasons there is a need to create a tool that facilitates communication of people who use pictograms to comunicate, a software capable of translating pictograms into natural language in spanish. There are currently multiple tools that allow the translation of natural language to pictograms but not tools which translate pictograms into natural language. This software tool will allow to break down barriers and help the inclusion of people with functional disabilities who are at risk of exclusion.


The main beneficiaries of this tool will be people with communication problems who need to rely on the pictograms to communicate, such as people with cerebral palsy, autism or any other type of cognitive disability.
Also, this work is designed to help these people to be able to communicate in any daily situation such as being able to order a refreshment in a bar, expressing their desire to eat macaroni, or expressing activities they have done or will be doing in the future, such as go on a excursion. Something so simple that unfortunately for these people it is not so much.

\section{Goals}

The main goal of this work is the creation of translator os text written with pictograms to texts written in natural language. The translator must create a grammatically correct text in Spanish and not just translate each pictogram by the word that represents.

The application, should be easy to use and should have a comfortable, accessible and intuitive interface, to reach the maximum possible public.

Also, to develop each of the functionalities of our application, we will use web services to create different and independent modules  that can be integrated into other applications. This will be very useful for other developers who can integrate our services in their application if they wish.

In this work we also seek to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the Software Engineering Degree and acquire new skills before leaving to work as university graduates.

\section {Work Methodology}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------

During this project we will follow a methodology with some of the typical characteristics of agile methodologies. We need an adaptive methodology given that at the beginning of the project we unknown if the project was viable, or how to develop it.

The communication with the tutors and between us will be constant since the beginning of the project to guarantee the quality of the product and obtain advice. We will be in contact through the mail to answer questions and, in addition, every two or three weeks there will be a meeting to review the work done and to establish the priorities of the remaining work and select what would be done until the next meeting.

To make secure that the project is on track at all times there will be constant deliveries of both memory and code. Two o three times at month, the memory and a functional version of the aplication will be revised by our advisors, to verify that we and to right track.

We will use a Kanban board to represent the status of the project in every moment. This board will also helped us with the organization, because there were limitations such as not working in the same place, or with the same schedule and we needed a board to obtain a glance status of the project. The priority of the work to be done will always be based on the value that these tasks granted to the final product. The Kanban board will be an information radiator for all the team, because at a glance each person could know the status of the project and each of it´s tasks. The columns of the board are:

\begin{itemize}
\item To Do: In this column are listed those tasks that are about to do. The tasks are ordered by priority so that at the beginning always appear the most priority and develop. After each meeting we added new tasks and readjusted the priorities.

\item In Progress: Tasks that are being developed. Each task in this column must be assigned to one of the members of the work team and the same person can not have more than one task assigned in this column, so the WIP(Work In Progress)\footnote{https://kanbanize.com/es/recursos-de-kanban/primeros-pasos/que-es-limite-wip/} of this column in our work is two. 
\item Test: All tasks completed by a team member are moved to this column to be reviewed by the other member of the team.
\item Revision: Tasks that the tutors are reviewing, to validate their correction before the next meeting.
\item Done: Tasks that after the review process are classified as done.
\end{itemize}

We have worked through sprints of two or three weeks. At the end of our meetings with our advisors we established the duration of the next sprint as well as the tasks to do during it. 

The version control system chosen is GitHub, using the NIL group account\footnote{https://github.com/NILGroup/TFG-1819-PictoTexto}. Using this account allowed us to have a private project that only members of the project could access. Once this project was finalized we will make the account public so that everyone could consult it.

\section{Document structure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------


This document is structured as follows. In Chapter \ref{cap:estadoDeLaCuestion} \textbf {(Estado de la cuestión)} we will talk about all the important aspects for the Generation of Natural Language, of the Augmentative and Alternative Communication Systems, and more specifically the pictograms, and the different pictographic systems currently available, and also we will introduce web services. In Chapter \ref{cap:Herramientas} \textbf {(Herramientas)} the different tools used for the preparation of this work are described. In this chapter we will present Django, Angular, Simple-NLG, the Arasaac API used to obtain the necessary information about the pictograms, and Spacy. In Chapter \ref{cap:Pict2Text} \textbf {(Pict2Text)}, the application developed in this project will be presented in detail. In Chapter \ref{cap:evaluacion} \textbf {(Evaluación)} the results of the evaluation carried out will be presented. In Chapter \ref{cap:trabajoInd} \textbf {(Trabajo individual)} 
the individual work carried out by each of the authors of this work will be exposed. Finally in Chapter \ref{cap:conclusiones} \textbf{(Conclusiones y Trabajo Futuro)} we will present the conclusions and the future work.
