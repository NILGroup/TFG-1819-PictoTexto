\chapter*{Abstract}

Communication is fundamental in social interaction and it makes integration and exchange possible. However, there are people who have certain functional diversities that affect their verbal communication so they must use pictograms to support communication.
Not everyone understands messages with pictograms and this prevents people who need to use them to communicate to have an effective communication. In this Final Degree Project we have developed a web application to help those people with communication difficulties to integrate into social enviroment by translating texts written with pictograms to texts written in natural language in Spanish. Now days, there is no application that makes a translation of pictograms into text, so our project can help to filling that gap helping to improve the quality of life of people who need pictograms to communicate.
The application has been developed using a component-based design, which allows other developers to integrate any of our components into their applications.
Finally, we have made an evaluation of the translations made by our application has been carried out to check the correctness of these and the results obtained are quite encouraging although there is still a lot of room for improvement. We can affirm that with the application developed in this work, solid bases have been established on which to continue working to improve the coverage and the correction of translated texts.
